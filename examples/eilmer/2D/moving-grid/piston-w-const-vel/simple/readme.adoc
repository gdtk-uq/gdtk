This example simulates the motion of a piston, at constant velocity, driving into ideal air.
It is an example that shows the use of the moving grid capability in Eilmer.
In the animation, you can see a fixed number of cells for the entire simulation.
These cells move during the course of the simulation.
In fact, it is is the user's job to supply the grid motion in these types of simulation.
This is done by specifying the velocities at the vertices in the grid.

The conditions for this simulation are:

* piston speed: 293.5 m/s
* initial pressure: 1.0e4 Pa
* initial temperature: 278.8 K

With these conditions, the resulting shock speed is 554.35 m/s.
This can be computed using the ideal shock relations.
If these flow conditions look familiar, it is because they have
been chosen to match conditions used in the classic Sod shock tube problem.

The conditions between the piston face and the shock have been computed
analytically. They are:

* pressure = 30.33 kPa
* temperature = 397.9 K
