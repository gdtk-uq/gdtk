README: on adding examples to the catalogue

1. READMEs for examples can/should be written as stand-alone
   READMEs in appropriate sub-directories.
   Think of these as self-contained documents.

2. Adding to the catalogue is a manual process and is done
   in this file. We gave it a somewhat cryptic name "elc.adoc"
   to discourage the casual user from trying to read this.
   This is a control document meant for processing with
   asciidoctor-reducer.

   In the catalogue, we want short descriptions.
   We pull these short descriptions from the full READMEs
   via asciidoctor's "tag" facility.

   To mark a section for inclusion in the catalogue description,
   enclose the section with markers:

   //tag::description[]

   //end::description[]

   Then in this document, use an "include" directive.
   There are examples of this below.
