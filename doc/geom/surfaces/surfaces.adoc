= Surfaces (Patches)

Surfaces or patches are elements that are parameterised in with two
coordinates.
In our definition, those coordinates are `r` and `s`, and
the range for each is from `0.0` to `1.0`.
The surface itself can be two-dimensional or three-dimensional.
Two-dimensional surfaces are often used in structured grid generation
for 2D simulations.
For this use case, we often refer to these entities are patches.
Three-dimensional surfaces can be used to represent faces
on 3D volumes, so they often turn up in 3D grid generation.

In the following, the syntax for various surface types is given
and described.
We have also produced some grids from the various surface types
to give you some idea of the effect of surface type choice.
Three example geometries, covering a modest range of use cases, have been chosen for the demonstration:

. a blunt-body grid
. a converging-diverging nozzle grid
. a duct-like grid

The examples appear at the end of this section.

== Coons patch

There are two constructors available for a Coons patch.
One accepts four `Path` objects, the other accepts four corner points ( `Vector3` s).
----
CoonsPatch:new{north, south, east, west}
----
----
CoonsPatch:new{p00, p10, p11, p01}
----

== Area-orthogonal patch

The area-orthogonal patch attempts to equalise the areas
of cells and maintain orthogonality at the edges.
The constructor is:
----
AOPatch:new{north, south, east, west, nx=10, ny=10}
----

The `nx` and `ny` parameters control the background grid
used to build an area-orthogonal patch.
The default is 10 background-cells in each direction.
If you have boundaries that have sections high curvature
you may need to increase the number of background cells.


Note that with default settings the blunt-body grid
results in negative cells near the shoulder
and the nozzle grid has cut the corner of the boundary.
This behaviour can be improved if some care is take
in selecting the background grid.
The next example, for the nozzle, increased the
background grid in the x-direction to `nx=40`
to give a better representation of the change
in geometry in the streamwise direction.
This is show here.

== Channel patch

The channel patch constructor is:
----
ChannelPatch:new{north, south, ruled=false, pure2D=false}
----

The channel patch builds an interpolated surface between
two bounding paths.
Those bounding paths are specified as `north` and `south`.
Bridging paths are built between the bounding paths.
By default, the cubic {bezier} curves are used as the bridging paths.
This choice provides good orthoganality of grid lines departing
the bounding paths.

If `ruled=true` is set, then the bridging curves are straight-line segments.

If `pure2D=true` is set, then all z-ordinates are set to 0.0.
This might be useful for purely two-dimensional constructions.

== Ruled surface
The constructor for a ruled surface is:
----
RuledSurface:new{edge0, edge1, ruled_direction='s', pured2D=false}
----

The ruled surface is used to build a surface connecting to
opposing paths with straight-line segments.
For example, a ruled surface based on south path (`sPath`)
and a north path (`nPath`) could be constructed as:
----
mySurf1 = RuledSurface:new{edge0=sPath, edge1=nPath}
----
In this case, the default `ruled_direction='s'` is appropriate.

For using west and east paths as the edge paths, the constructor is:
----
mySurf2 = RuledSurface:new{edge0=wPath, edge1=ePath, ruled_direction='r'}
----

The constructor also accepts `i` and `j` as direction designators
in place of `r` and `s`.

If `pure2D=true` is set, then all z-ordinates are set to 0.0.
This might be useful for purely two-dimensional constructions.

== Control point patch
The control point patch is an algebraic surface type with
interior control of grid lines by means of control points.
There are two constructors available.
One accepts the control points directly, as created independently by the caller.
The other constructor acceps the number of control points in each logical
dimension and a guide patch.
The guide patch is used to create and distribute the control points.
The constructors are:
----
ControlPointPatch:new{north, south, east, west, control_points}
----
----
ControlPointPatch:new{north, south, east, west,
                      ncpi, ncpj, guide_patch}
----

For the first constructor, the `control_points` are listed as a table of tables such
that the points are given as a 2D array.

For the second constructor, `ncpi` and `ncpj` are integers specifying the numbers
of control points in the `i` and `j` dimensions, respectively.
The `guide_patch` is given as a string; supported options are:

* `"coons"`
* `"aopatch"`
* `"channel"`
* `"channel-e2w"`

The channel patch is defined assuming that the north and south boundaries are the
bounding walls of the channel.
When using a channel patch as a guide patch for the ControlPointPatch,
it is sometimes convenient to have the channel oriented with
east and west boundaries as bounding walls.
The `guide_patch` set to `"channel-e2w"` gives that option.

More information about the control point patch is
available in the technical note
https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/docs/eilmer/technical-notes/control-point-grid-gen/[Control Point Form Grid Generation].

== Patch examples for 2D grid generation

These examples show how the various patch types work
on a common set of bounding geometries.

Note that with default settings the blunt-body grid
generated with the Area-orthogonal patch results
in negative cells near the shoulder.
To remedy this, increase the `ny` value for number
of points in the background grid to get better
resolution of the geometry change around the shoulder.

Here the Area-orthogonal patch with default settings
as cut the corner of the boundary on the nozzle domain.
This behaviour can be improved if some care is take
in selecting the background grid.
We show this here by  increasing the
background grid in the x-direction to `nx=40`
to give a better representation of the change
in geometry in the streamwise direction.

=== A duct grid

This duct grid mimics the example in Eiseman (1988)
A control point form of algebraic grid generation.
The channel patch and ruled surface are not appropriate
for this domain because the curved boundaries on both
the north and east edges.
As such, they are not generated for this example.
