= Grid preparation

Grids may be built with the Eilmer built-in gridding tools or built in a 3rd-party gridder and imported.
This section describes the high-level functions for importing and registering grids.
Grids need to be registered during the grid preparation stage for later use
in defining fluid or solid blocks.
The details of building individual Grid objects is not covered here.
Those details can be found in xref:../geom/grid/grid-user.adoc#grid-user[Grid objects].


== Importing grids

`importGridproGrid(filename[, scale])`

`filename`:: name of Gridpro multi-block grid file
`scale`:: value by which to scale the grid coordinates (default: 1.0)

`importPlot3DGrid(filename, dim[, scale])`

`filename`:: name of Plot3D file (needs to be in text format)
`dim`:: dimensionality of grid: 2 or 3
`scale`:: value by which to scale the grid coordinates (default: 1.0)

SU2 import is via the `UnstructuredGrid` object directly:

`UnstructuredGrid:new{filename=filename, fmt='su2text'[, scale=1.0]}`

`filename`:: name of SU2 grid file
`fmt`:: supply 'su2text' as format to import an SU2 grid
`scale`:: value by which to scale the grid coordinates (default: 1.0)


== Registered grids

We construct `RegisteredGrid` objects so that we can set information about boundary conditions
and the initial condition in the volume defined by the grid.

`registerFluidGrid{grid, tag, fsTag, bcTags, omegaz}`

`grid`:: a `Grid` object, required. +
  This might be created as `StructuredGrid` or `UnstructuredGrid` objects,
  or grid objects created during an import call.

`tag`:: _string_, optional +
  A user-supplied tag that might be used to identify a grid or collection of grids

`fsTag`:: _string_, required +
  Will be used to select the initial flow condition from a dictionary when the FluidBlock is later constructucted

`bcTags`:: a table of strings +
  These tags will be used to attach boundary conditions from a dictionary when the FluidBlock is later constructed

`omegaz` ::
  _float_, default: `0.0` +
  angular speed (in rad/s about the _z_-axis) for the rotating frame of reference. +
  Useful for the calculation of flow in turbomachines.
  The default value of 0.0 implies no rotating frame.

The integer id of the RegisteredGrid object in the gridsList is returned.


A registered `GridArray` can be constructed by carving a single structured grid into registered subgrids.
This does not work on unstructured grids.

`registerFluidGridArray{grid, tag, fsTag, bcTags, nib, njb, nkb, shock_fitting, omegaz}`

`grid`:: a `Grid` object, required +
  This might be created as `StructuredGrid` or `UnstructuredGrid` objects,
  or grid objects created during an import call.

`tag`:: _string_, optional +
  A user-supplied tag that might be used to identify a grid or collection of grids

`fsTag`:: _string_, required +
  Will be used to select the initial flow condition from a dictionary when the FluidBlocks are later constructucted

`bcTags`:: a table of strings +
  These tags will be used to attach boundary conditions from a dictionary when the FluidBlocks are later constructed

`nib`:: _int_, default `1` +
  Number of blocks to use for subdivision in `i` grid direction

`njb`:: _int_, default `1` +
  Number of blocks to use for subdivision in `j` grid direction

`nkb`:: _int_, default `1` +
  Number of blocks to use for subdivision in `k` grid direction
  (has no meaning for 2D grids)

`shock_fitting`:: _boolean_, default `false` +
  Set to `true` if using a shock-fit `WEST` boundary

`omegaz` ::
  _float_, default: `0.0` +
  angular speed (in rad/s about the _z_-axis) for the rotating frame of reference. +
  Useful for the calculation of flow in turbomachines.
  The default value of 0.0 implies no rotating frame.

The integer id of the GridArray object within the gridArrayList is returned.
The GridArray object contains arrays of all of the structured-grid objects defined
over the partitioned grid:

`grids` ::
  will be a multi-dimensional array of Grid objects (that are the subgrids of the original grid).
  This array is indexed as `[ib][jb]` in 2D and `[ib][jb][kb]` in 3D,
  with `1<=ib<=nib`, `1<=jb<=njb`, `1<=kb<=nkb`.

`myGrids` ::
  will be a multi-dimensional array of registered-grid ids.
  This array is indexed as `[ib][jb]` in 2D and `[ib][jb][kb]` in 3D,
  with `1<=ib<=nib`, `1<=jb<=njb`, `1<=kb<=nkb`.

`gridCollection` ::
  will be a single-dimensional array of registered-grid ids.
  Note that the index within this array starts at 1, following the Lua convention.


== Connecting registered grids

When constructing a domain from more than one structured grid,
you can call the function `identifyGridConnections()` to identify the cases where
one registered grid interfaces with another and their boundaries are cleanly aligned.
Connections can be applied manually for cases where you want one grid boundary face connected to another
and the corresponding boundaries are not geometrically aligned.
Non-unity transformation matrices can be provided for cases where the flow vector quantities
need to be reoriented when they are copied from one boundary to the other.

`connectGrids(idA, faceA, idB, faceB, orientation, reorient_vector_quantities, RmatrixA, RmatrixB)`

`idA`:: _int_ +
  Id of the first structured grid (grid-A).

`faceA`:: _string_ +
  Label of the boundary face on grid-A.

`idB`:: _int_ +
  Id of the second structured grid (grid-B).

`faceB`:: _string_ +
  Label of the boundary face on grid-B.

`orientation`:: _int_: default: `0` +
  For 2D simulations, there is only one possible orientation for each face-to-face connection,
  so you don't need to specify the value of the orientation.
  For 3D simulations, the default value of `0` is for a face-to-face connection
  where the corresponding index directions for each grid's face are aligned.
  There are 4 possible orientations (`0` thru `3`) for the connection between the faces of 3D grids
  and the `tabulatedData` starting from line 111 in the source file `blk_conn.lua` documents
  the full set of possibilities.
  The user is responsible for selecting the correct value.

`reorient_vector_quantities`::
  _boolean_, default: `false` +
  If true, vector flow quantities are multiplied by the `Rmatrix` as they are copied from
  the source cell into the destination ghost cell.

`RmatrixA`::
  _array of float_, default: {1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0} +
  This is a 3-by-3 matrix written in row-major format.
  It is applied, in the usual matrix-vector multiply manner, to vector flow quantities
  such as velocity and magnetic field as they are copied into the block associated with the grid-A.
  The user is responsible for computing appropriate coefficients.

`RmatrixB`::
  _array of float_, default: {1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0} +
  As for RmatrixA, but for vector flow quantities that are being copied to the block associated
  with grid-B
