# Our collection of external modules.

These have come from several sources.
We keep a copy here so that we don't depend upon an internet connection at build time.

Where and when did we take snapshots:

* OpenMPI https://github.com/DlangScience/OpenMPI 2017-06-05
* gzip
* opencl.d
* equilibrium-c: https://github.com/uqngibbo/equilibrium-c (4fcbeb4: 2025-06-04)
* D-YAML: https://github.com/dlang-community/D-YAML.git (2020-09-26)
* tinyendian: https://github.com/dlang-community/tinyendian.git (2020-09-26)

For D-YAML and tinyendian, we have stripped out files that we don't use, e.g. tests.
